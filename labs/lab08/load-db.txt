Load the university schema into your database (see earlier part of the assignment) if you
haven't loaded it already. If you have loaded the schema + data, you need to drop tables
first.

1. Do not use pgadmin3/pgadmin4 for loading data as it may hang.
2. open terminal and start psql with appropriate port number and database name (refer 1st lab
on PostgreSQL setup)
3. From within psql, run the command  \i <filename>
    e.g.just type the following to load the schema:
        \i DDL.sql      
    and after schema is loaded, type:
        \i largeRelationsInsertFile.sql
    Run the command from the same directory where you saved the file.
4. You will see "INSERT 0 1" being printed for every insert. It will take some time but will
terminate successfully. You may see an unchanging screen even though the system is
continuously printing the above line. Hit enter to see if prints are ongoing.
