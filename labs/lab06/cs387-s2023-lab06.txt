First create two tables r(a varchar(10) primary key, b varchar(10)) and delta_r(op char(1),
a varchar(10), b varchar(10)). Your goal is to ensure that whenever a tuple is inserted into
table r, the same tuple is inserted into delta_r, with op having value 'I'.

You only need to handle
    insert into r values (...)

Anything that does not start with insert into r values can be ignored.
If you make any other assumptions, just state it in your code.

To explore PostgreSQL, use the debugger, set a breakpoint at exec_simple_query (in postgres.c)
and find the contents of query string. Next, if the query string is an insert into table r,
modify it by appending the extra insert into delta_r.  Note that in postgresql, a query string
can have multiple commands separated by semicolons.

Submit only the relevant part of the file postgres.c, do not submit any other file. Name your
file as rollno1_rollno2.c where rollno1 and rollno2 are your roll numbers.

If you have added any header files or defined new functions to do your work, you can put them
at the top of your submission file, and then have the inserted code prefixed by comments 
/* CS 387 begin */ and suffixed with /* CS 387 end */.
