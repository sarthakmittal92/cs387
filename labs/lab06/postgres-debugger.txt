You can find all the files here:
https://github.com/postgres/postgres/tree/REL_14_STABLE/src/backend
Use the "Go to file" feature to search for the file by name

Go to backend>main and open main.c. Scroll down and you will find a call to PostgresMain,
which is the actual main function for the backend

Use open declaration on Eclipse to open the file containing PostgresMain() (this is in
postgres.c)

Scroll down and you will find that simple queries are executed by calling exec_simple_query().

Open the declaration of that function. (This is also in postgres.c)

You can see what are the key steps in processing a simple query in this function. You can set
breakpoints at pg_analyze_and_rewrite and at pg_plan_queries to see how a query is planned.

A "portal" is a ready-to-execute statement, and PortalRun executes the statement. Here's a partial call sequence for executing a select query.
    1. ExecutorRun
    2. ExecutePlan
    3. ExecProcNode (this is a function pointer in plan, which is used to call the appropriate
    function depending on the operator type; execProcnode.c has more details). See the header
    notes in execProcnode.c for a more detailed example of the execution sequence.
    4. Here are some files that help understand what is happening:
        Access methods: Look at header comments of access/heap/heapam.c, access/index/indexam.c
        and access/nbtree/nbtree.c
