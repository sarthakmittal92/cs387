You have to write a python program named <roll_no1>_<roll_no2>_outlab_3.py, which supports the
following flags, and the output should be flushed to the standard output stream.

In this part of the assignment you will need to query the postgresql information schema to get
the necessary information.

1. "--import-sql --path <file_path>" - load sql statements from the file "<file_path>" into the
database. (5 marks)

2. "--show-tables" - output the list of tables in the given database sorted alphabetically and
each table name on a new line. Do NOT include system tables in this list. (10 marks)

3. "--show-table-schema --table <table_name>" - output the table's schema such that it can be
run to create the table. The output should thus be in the form of
    create table <table_name> (
        column_1 datatype<(optional character length of the datatype)>,
        column_2 datatype<(optional character length of the datatype)>,
        ...
        column_n datatype<(optional character length of the datatype)>,
        PRIMARY KEY (column_i, column_j, column_k, ...),
        FOREIGN KEY (column_p1, column_q1, column_r1, ...) references table_u1(column_x1, column_y1, column_z1, ...) <ON DELETE STATEMENT if specified in schema>,
        ...
        FOREIGN KEY (column_pn, column_qn, column_rn, ...) references table_un(column_xn, column_yn, column_zn, ...) <ON DELETE STATEMENT if specified in schema>,
        UNIQUE (column_a1, column_b1,...),
        ...
        UNIQUE (column_am, column_bm,...)
    );
Note that the order of the columns should be maintained. You can ignore any other type of
constraints and indices while dumping the schema. Any order of columns in constraints and the
order of constraints will be fine. The mapping of columns in the foreign keys should be correct.
You should handle any arbitrary valid datatype of the columns. (30 marks)

4. "--export-database-schema" - output the complete schema of the database. The challenge here
is to output these in such a manner that foreign key constraints are not violated. You may
assume that the schema does not involve complex elements such as indices, views, etc. There are
no constraints other than primary key, foreign key and unique constraints. The output should
contain only create table statements. Any order of output that runs without errors will work.
(30 marks)

The program will be run as:
    python3 <roll_no1>_<roll_no2>_outlab_3.py --name <database_name> --user <username> --pswd <password> --host <host_address> --port <port>
followed by one of the above sets of flags. Each part will be auto-graded independently of
other parts.
